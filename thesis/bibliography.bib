               are attracting enormous research attention for their ability to
               respond (typically deform) under external stimuli. The design
               process for such smart materials requires iterations of
               finite-element simulations that are computationally expensive.
               Recently, researchers have tried replacing numerical simulations
               with machine learning (ML) models to predict the output at a
               much higher speed. However, there exist very few studies that
               explore the model algorithm's expressive capacity and analyze
               the physical interpretation based on the problem. This paper
               focuses on using ML to predict the nonlinear deformation
               behavior of digital materials. Various problem construction
               approaches and model performance are compared and discussed. It
               is shown that clustering the materials helps improve the
               generalization of training and models that treat material
               features as an array of numbers still face difficulties to
               provide accurate predictions. Inspired by modern computer vision
               technologies, convolutional kernels outperform other methods by
               recognizing the material distribution patterns. The performance
               is further enhanced after reconstructing the regression problem
               into classification. Moreover, high-level material design
               information can be extracted from the model through a
               sensitivity analysis. This framework may greatly improve the
               response prediction and design process for 4D-printed smart
               materials.",

  title    = "Generative machine learning algorithm for lattice structures with
              superior mechanical properties",
  author   = "Lee, Sangryun and Zhang, Zhizhou and Gu, Grace X",
  abstract = "Lattice structures are typically made up of a crisscross pattern
              of beam elements, allowing engineers to distribute material in a
              more structurally effective way. However, a main challenge in the
              design of lattice structures is a trade-off between the density
              and mechanical properties. Current studies have often assumed the
              cross-sectional area of the beam elements to be uniform for
              reducing the design complexity. This simplified approach limits
              the possibility of finding superior designs with optimized
              weight-to-performance ratios. Here, the optimized shape of the
              beam elements is investigated using a deep learning approach with
              high-order B{\'e}zier curves to explore the augmented design
              space. This is then combined with a hybrid neural network and
              genetic optimization (NN-GO) adaptive method for the generation
              of superior lattice structures. In our optimized design, the
              distribution of material is smartly shifted more towards the
              joint region, the weakest location of lattice structures, to
              achieve the highest modulus and strength. This design strikes to
              balance between two modes of deformation: axial and bending.
              Thus, the optimized design is efficient for load bearing and
              energy absorption. To validate our simulations, the optimized
              design is then fabricated by additive manufacturing and its
              mechanical properties are evaluated through compression testing.
              A good correlation between experiments and simulations is
              observed and the optimized design has outperformed benchmark ones
              in terms of modulus and strength. We show that the extra design
              flexibility from high-order B{\'e}zier curves allows for a
              smoother transition between the beam elements which reduces the
              overall stress concentration profile.",
