# Acronyms

- **DEM** Discrete Element Method, i.e. a dynamic simulation of a system comprized of ideal masses, linear springs and linear dampers in which the equations of motion have been determined simply with Newton's second law.

- **FEM** Finite Element Method.

- **GA** Genetic Algorithm.

- **MMGA** Genetic Algorithm which uses a metamodel to calculate the loss function.

- **NMMGA** Genetic Algorithm which doesn't use a metamodel to calculate the loss function.

- **ML** Machine Learning.

- **MSDS** One-dimensional Masses-Springs-Dampers System, i.e. a one dimensional mechanical system composed of ideal masses, linear springs and linear dampers.

- **NN** Artificial Neural Network (ML model).

- **PINN** Physics Informed Neural Network.
