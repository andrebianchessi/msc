# Acronyms

- **DES** Discrete Element Simulation, i.e. a dynamic simulation of a system comprized of ideal masses, springs and dampers in which the equations of motion have been determined simply with Newton's second law.

- **FEM** Finite Element Method.

- **GA** Genetic Algorithm.

- **MMGA** Genetic Algorithm which uses a metamodel to calculate the cost function.

- **NMMGA** Genetic Algorithm which doesn't use a metamodel to calculate the cost function.

- **ML** Machine Learning.

- **MSDS** "Masses-Springs-Dampers System", i.e. a mechanical system composed of ideal masses, springs and dampers.

- **NN** Artificial Neural Network (ML model).
