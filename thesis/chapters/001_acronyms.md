- **ETE** Explicit Time Integration, i.e. numerical method for obtaining approximate solution to time-dependent ordinary differential equation.

- **FEM** Finite Element Method.

- **GA** Genetic Algorithm.

- **ML** Machine Learning.

- **MSDS** One-dimensional Masses-Springs-Dampers System, i.e. a one dimensional mechanical system composed of ideal masses, linear springs and linear dampers.
