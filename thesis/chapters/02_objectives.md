# Objectives
TODO:

- Compare the cost and optimal solution obtained for each method.
    - How do the 3 methods compare (cost and optimal solution obtained)?
    - Did the AI ever kick in for the method we proposed?
    - For the metamodels, which had best results (Regression, PINN, …)?
    - Do all methods find similar results, or does one find a solution
    with much smaller passenger’s acceleration?
