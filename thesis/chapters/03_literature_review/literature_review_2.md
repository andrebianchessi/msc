## Genetic Algorithm

*The genetic algorithm is an optimization and search technique based on the principles of genetics and natural selection* [@Haupt2004-hj]. Some of its advantages, when compared to gradient base methods, are [@Haupt2004-hj]:
- Doesnâ€™t require derivative information
- Simultaneously searches from a wide sampling of the cost surface
- Deals with a large number of variables
- Is well suited for parallel computers
- Optimizes variables with extremely complex cost surfaces (they can jump out of local minima)
