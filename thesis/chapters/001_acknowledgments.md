# Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Professor Marcilio Alves, for his invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout this work. His expertise and insights were instrumental in shaping this thesis and propelling me forward.

I am also particularly grateful for my informal co-advisor, Professor Larissa Driemeier, for her guidance in *"all-things-ML"* related. I can't overstate how much her expertise and willingness to share her knowledge were crucial for the success of this work.

Furthermore, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Lucas Barroso Knupp, Felipe Yamaguti, and Thiago Estrela Montenegro for the stimulating discussions and valuable insights they provided throughout my research.

This work really *"took a village"*, so and I am truly grateful for the support of all these individuals.
