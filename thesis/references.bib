  author   = "Lee, Sangryun and Zhang, Zhizhou and Gu, Grace X",
  abstract = "Lattice structures are typically made up of a crisscross pattern
              of beam elements, allowing engineers to distribute material in a
              more structurally effective way. However, a main challenge in the
              design of lattice structures is a trade-off between the density
              and mechanical properties. Current studies have often assumed the
              cross-sectional area of the beam elements to be uniform for
              reducing the design complexity. This simplified approach limits
              the possibility of finding superior designs with optimized
              weight-to-performance ratios. Here, the optimized shape of the
              beam elements is investigated using a deep learning approach with
              high-order B{\'e}zier curves to explore the augmented design
              space. This is then combined with a hybrid neural network and
              genetic optimization (NN-GO) adaptive method for the generation
              of superior lattice structures. In our optimized design, the
              distribution of material is smartly shifted more towards the
              joint region, the weakest location of lattice structures, to
              achieve the highest modulus and strength. This design strikes to
              balance between two modes of deformation: axial and bending.
              Thus, the optimized design is efficient for load bearing and
              energy absorption. To validate our simulations, the optimized
              design is then fabricated by additive manufacturing and its
              mechanical properties are evaluated through compression testing.
              A good correlation between experiments and simulations is
              observed and the optimized design has outperformed benchmark ones
              in terms of modulus and strength. We show that the extra design
              flexibility from high-order B{\'e}zier curves allows for a
              smoother transition between the beam elements which reduces the
              overall stress concentration profile.",

               catastrophically in the presence of cracks. Incorporating softer
               constituents into brittle materials can alleviate stress
               concentration, leading to tougher and stronger composites.
               However, searching for the optimal designs of composites is
               extremely challenging due to the astronomical number of possible
               material and geometry combinations. Here, we apply machine
               learning to a composite system and demonstrate its capacity to
               accurately and efficiently predict mechanical properties
               including toughness and strength. The method we used
               incorporates machine learning techniques to generate optimal
               designs with orders of magnitude better than the mean properties
               of the input training data, and at a much lower computational
