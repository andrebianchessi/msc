  abstract = "We present a tutorial on how to directly implement integration of
              ordinary differential equations through recurrent neural networks
              using Python. In order to simplify the implementation, we
              leveraged modern machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow
              and Keras. Besides, offering implementation of basic models (such
              as multilayer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks) and
              optimization methods, these frameworks offer powerful automatic
              differentiation. With all that, the main advantage of our
              approach is that one can implement hybrid models combining
              physics-informed and data-driven kernels, where data-driven
              kernels are used to reduce the gap between predictions and
              observations. Alternatively, we can also perform model parameter
              identification. In order to illustrate our approach, we used two
              case studies. The first one consisted of performing fatigue crack
              growth integration through Euler's forward method using a hybrid
              model combining a data-driven stress intensity range model with a
              physics-based crack length increment model. The second case study
              consisted of performing model parameter identification of a
              dynamic two-degree-of-freedom system through Runge--Kutta
              integration. The examples presented here as well as source codes

              structure",
  author   = "Driemeier, Larissa",
  abstract = "Reengineering in structural analysis can be seen as a process
              adopted when the structure needs a redesign to meet performance
              requirements or when the input parameters need frequent
              adjustments within a fixed domain. It is particularly challenging
              when the redesign involves complex structures, optimization, non-
              deterministic material characteristics, geometric or material
              nonlinearities. These complex analyzes have high computational
              costs, that make real-time use difficult and requires
              sophisticated and expensive software and hardware. One way to
              overcome these drawbacks is to reengineer applying metamodels
              calibrated by machine learning approaches. In another words, the
              use of Artificial Intelligence can reduce the maintenance costs
              and enable real-time redesign for complex situations. In our
              study, a metamodel is proposed to analyze 3D nonlinear structures
              subjected to plastic deformations and large strains, via an
              artificial neural network. The nonlinearities and the associated
              snap through and snapback behavior are all dealt with by a net
              training based on 10,000 Force vs Displacement curves (target
              outputs) obtained from nonlinear finite element analyses. This
              interplay between finite element analysis and machine learning is
              shown here to be a promising technique. The results indicate that
              the proposed deep neural network is capable to learn the finite
              element simulation. The presented discussion aims to indicate
              when the use of AI in the analysis of nonlinear structures is
              justified."

  abstract  = "Composites are widely used to create tunable materials to
               achieve superior mechanical properties. Brittle materials fail
               catastrophically in the presence of cracks. Incorporating softer
               constituents into brittle materials can alleviate stress
               concentration, leading to tougher and stronger composites.
               However, searching for the optimal designs of composites is
               extremely challenging due to the astronomical number of possible
               material and geometry combinations. Here, we apply machine
               learning to a composite system and demonstrate its capacity to
               accurately and efficiently predict mechanical properties
               including toughness and strength. The method we used
               incorporates machine learning techniques to generate optimal
               designs with orders of magnitude better than the mean properties
               of the input training data, and at a much lower computational
               cost compared to exhaustive methods. Additionally, the method
               can further rebuild the detailed performances of the designs,
               even when this information is lost in the training process. The
               results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to search
               for optimal designs with very limited training data. To
               demonstrate the application of machine learning to composite
               design, we optimize a large-scale system not tractable by an
               exhaustive brute force approach and show that it is a promising
               tool towards composite design. This work offers a new
               perspective in the exploration of design spaces and accelerating
               the discovery of new functional, customizable composites.",

  title    = "Generative machine learning algorithm for lattice structures with
              superior mechanical properties",
  author   = "Lee, Sangryun and Zhang, Zhizhou and Gu, Grace X",
  abstract = "Lattice structures are typically made up of a crisscross pattern
              of beam elements, allowing engineers to distribute material in a
              more structurally effective way. However, a main challenge in the
              design of lattice structures is a trade-off between the density
              and mechanical properties. Current studies have often assumed the
              cross-sectional area of the beam elements to be uniform for
              reducing the design complexity. This simplified approach limits
              the possibility of finding superior designs with optimized
              weight-to-performance ratios. Here, the optimized shape of the
              beam elements is investigated using a deep learning approach with
              high-order B{\'e}zier curves to explore the augmented design
              space. This is then combined with a hybrid neural network and
              genetic optimization (NN-GO) adaptive method for the generation
              of superior lattice structures. In our optimized design, the
              distribution of material is smartly shifted more towards the
              joint region, the weakest location of lattice structures, to
              achieve the highest modulus and strength. This design strikes to
              balance between two modes of deformation: axial and bending.
              Thus, the optimized design is efficient for load bearing and
              energy absorption. To validate our simulations, the optimized
              design is then fabricated by additive manufacturing and its
              mechanical properties are evaluated through compression testing.
              A good correlation between experiments and simulations is
              observed and the optimized design has outperformed benchmark ones
              in terms of modulus and strength. We show that the extra design
              flexibility from high-order B{\'e}zier curves allows for a
              smoother transition between the beam elements which reduces the
              overall stress concentration profile.",

               with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) that have counterintuitive
               behavior compared with monolithic materials. These NPR
               materials, referred to as auxetics, are relevant to engineering
               sciences because of their unique mechanical expansion. Previous
               studies have explored compliant actuators using analytical and
               numerically derived mechanics of materials principles. However,
               the control of compliant gradient mechanisms frequently uses
               complex analytical equations combined with traditional control
               algorithms, making them difficult to design. To confront the
               design processes and computational load, herein, machine
               learning is used to predict errors in compliant auxetic designs
               based on a mathematically optimal deformation. Finite element
               analysis and experimental specimens validate the theoretical
               mechanical behavior of a specific auxetic configuration as well
               as demonstrate the capabilities of additive manufacturing of
               graded auxetic materials. Pseudorandomized images and their
               respective computational deformation results are used to train a
               regressive model and predict the deviation from optimal
               behavior. The model predicts the deviation from the desired
               behavior with a mean average percent error below 5\% for the
               validation set. Subsequently, a scalable workflow design process
